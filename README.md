### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I like technology, finance, and hard problems. Sometimes I like all three at the same time.

Things that interest me at the moment:
* Building complex enterprise user interfaces in TypeScript and React that are performant and reliable at scale
* Architecting distributed micro services in Java and Spring Boot
* Finance, data analysis, ai, and scripting in Python
* Cloud native architecture and devops with AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes
